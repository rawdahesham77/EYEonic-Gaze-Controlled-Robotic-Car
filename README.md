## 📖 Overview

EYEonic is our **A+ Graduation Project**, developed to explore how Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision can improve accessibility for people with mobility impairments.

The system tracks the user's eye movements using a webcam and converts them into navigation commands that are sent wirelessly to an ESP32-controlled robotic car, enabling hands-free movement.

This project combines software and hardware to create an intelligent, affordable, and non-invasive mobility solution.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Millions of people with mobility impairments rely on traditional control methods that may not always be practical or accessible.

Our goal was to design an affordable system capable of controlling a robotic vehicle using only eye movements.

---

## 💡 Solution

The system captures live video from a webcam and detects facial landmarks using **MediaPipe Face Mesh**.

Eye movements are analyzed using **OpenCV**, converted into movement commands, and transmitted to an **ESP32** via serial communication.

The ESP32 then controls the motors through an **L298N Motor Driver**, allowing the robotic car to move in real time.

## 🧠 System Logic

The EYEonic system follows a real-time processing pipeline that converts eye movements into robotic navigation commands.
